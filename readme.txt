- set up files for real web development environment
	- get html skeleton from web (see link on hackpad)
	- then add html, css, and jquery code
	- for css and jquery code, decide whether you want to keep it
	in the main file along with the html code or you want to place
	it in a different file. Depending on your decision, the 
 	commands are a little different (cf. code).
